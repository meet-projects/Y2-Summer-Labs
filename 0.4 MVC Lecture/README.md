# MVC (Mini Lab)

## Objective: 
In this lab, you will implement the MVC map, trying to *grasp* the **concept of MVC** as much as possible before moving on to **Flask**!

## Review:

0. Pair up with a partner, and draw the layout of an **MVC Map**!
    - It can be done using a paper and pen.  

## Exploring MVC

1. Startup idea: A youtube, but just for cat videos: cattube.com. We want to keep this website simple, so users should be able to do two things: upload a new cat video and display all of the published cat videos in order.

    (a) Split up cattube according to MVC. What information belongs to each component?
    
    (b) Do Python classes belong in M, V, or C?
    
    (c) In pseudocode, what Python classes, in addition to a User class, should you define for this website?
    
       

##### Great job! Call an Instructor/TA to check your completed tasks!




## Bonus tasks!

2. Discussion question: 

    (a) What are some advantages of MVC? 
    
    (b) What are some disadvantages of MVC? 
    
3. Put on your MVC glasses: Can you come up with other MVC examples? Which parts correspond to which letter? (Crazier examples are better; you can analyze pretty much anything with the MVC mindset!!)
